# FoodZone-Web-App-Front-End
This repository contains the front end of FoodZone, a restaurant delivery search app. 
This group project was intended to allow users to get the most cost effective and time efficient meal when placing an order for food delivery. 
When it comes to food, something that's very desired is finding the cheapest solution to ordering a meal. 
Platforms like Google and Yelp, while being helpful in showing restaurants nearby, lack the ability to show all delivery options for a restaurant and their fees. 
Delivery services like Uber Eats and GrubHub always make orders look cheap at first but the final cost ends up being much higher when all fees and taxes are added on. 
Being able to have an app that can find the cheapest way to get a meal delivered was something valuable to our team and something we belived anyone looking to save money when ordering out would also value. 
We intend our app to deal with these issues by showing estimated delivery fees beforehand, helping users make more cost effective choices.


The front end was developed collaboratively on CodeSandBox. 
The wireframes, userflow, and proposed database ERD can be found in the 'project_design_diagrams' folder. 

NOTE: this repository contains front-end code that was planned to hook up to a back-end. 
Many elements in this code are placeholders that were planned to be replaced/supplemented by back-end code.
